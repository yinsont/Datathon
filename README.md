Analysis of NYC-311 Service Request Data (2023–2024 Focus)

Background

The NYC 311 Service Request dataset records all non-emergency requests made by residents to city services. These include issues such as noise complaints, air quality concerns, sanitation problems, illegal parking, and more. This open dataset provides a valuable opportunity to understand the everyday challenges faced by New Yorkers and evaluate how effectively city agencies respond to them.

Problem Statements and Motivation

In this datathon, we focus on the 2023 and 2024 data from the NYC 311 system. Our goal is to uncover meaningful insights into the city’s most recent non-emergency service trends.

Specifically, we aim to answer the following questions:
	1.	What are the most and least common types of service requests in 2023 and 2024?
	2.	Which boroughs generated the highest and lowest number of service requests?
	3.	When do service requests peak?
	•	By time of year (seasonality)
	•	By time of day
	4.	What is the distribution of air quality complaints across different boroughs?
	5.	Which agencies demonstrated the best performance in resolving service requests?
	6.	From which types of locations are most complaints reported?

	•	Insights into complaint patterns by time (seasonal and daily trends).
	•	Analysis of air quality-related complaints across the city.
